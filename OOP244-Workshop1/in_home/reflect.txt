1. What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
Namespace: A namespace is a scope for the entities that it encloses.
Purpose: Its purpose is to avoid naming conflicts when the same identifiers are used for different variables in the application.  Each part of an application and scoping variables are enclosed within their own namespace.
 
2. Why header files are needed? Explain.
In a nutshell, header files are needed for organizing an application's code.  A header files declares function prototypes, while the implementation file defines them.
A header file is also important so that it can safeguard the prototypes from pre-compiler errors, and ensure that definitions of function prototypes are only defined once in a header file.
